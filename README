The String::Parity module for perl5 may be used to generate and test
even, odd, mark and space parity on arbitrary strings.

To install this module, cd to the directory that this README file is
in and type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

The 'make test' line is optional.

Documentation for this module is part of the file Parity.pm using
the pod (Plain Old Documentation) format.  To convert it into manual
page format, type something like the following:

	pod2man Parity.pm > Parity.man

To convert it into html format, type:

	pod2html Parity.pm

(pod2html automatically creates a file named Parity.html)
